# Feature Extraction & Stock Price Prediction Pipeline (for training on Multiple Stocks)

A Streamlit based application to extract features and predict future Stock Price. 
In this application, I have developed a Pipeline to let anyone train their own multiple Machine Learning models on multiple stocks simultanously to generate Buy/Sell Signals using the best model. 

I have also created a Kaggle Dataset using the extracted features for Nasdaq-100 companies.

## There are 3 Dashboards in the web application - 

***1. Stock Exploration & Feature Extraction***

***2. Train ML Models for next day Stock Price Prediction***

***3. Train LSTM network for future Stock Price Prediction beyond just next day***

This is a WIP and I will keep on adding new ideas to this in future.
